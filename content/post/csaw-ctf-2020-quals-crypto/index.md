I played with Fword Team in CSAW CTF Qualification Round 2020 and managed to solve all the crypto tasks :partying_face:
![](c.png)

To be honnest, I think the tasks were poorly designed and guessy. In this article, I'll provide writeups for:

  - [x] difib
  - [x] modus_operandi
  - [x] authy
  - [x] adversarial
  - [x] smallsurp

# difib
![](difib.png)

> Hints 
>  1. Length of keys is 25, which (cleaned-up) ramblings would fit that?
>  2. If near-perfect ramblings are used to encrypt in order, how should it be decrypted?
>  3. The guard want's a legible message they can read in!
  
From the challenge's title we can guess that this is going to be about **[bifid cipher]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifid_cipher). We will need to decode the message give: `snbwmuotwodwvcywfgmruotoozaiwghlabvuzmfobhtywftopmtawyhifqgtsiowetrksrzgrztkfctxnrswnhxshylyehtatssukfvsnztyzlopsv` using a key from the ramblings given:

For bifid cipher, they key needs to be a perfect pangram with 25 chars long. A perfect pangram is a sentence that uses each letter of the alphabet only one time. 
We can see in our encrypted message that the letter '***j***'  isn't used. That will help us deduce that key doesn't have the letter '***j***' . From the first hint, we have clean up the ramblings, so first of all we will remove every non-alphabetic char and the letter j. With every thing cleaned-up we will have 20 possible keys:

I've tried using each one of them but none worked. Then, I tried using all the keys inverted and successively and got the message.

`xustxsomexunnecessaryxtextxthatxholdsxabsolutelyxnoxmeaningxwhatsoeverxandxbearsxnoxsignificancextoxyouxinxanyxway`

Cleaning up that message we will have: 

`just some unnecessary text that holds absolutely no meaning whatsoever and bears no significance to you in any way`

Sending that to the server gives us the flag.

![](bifid-0.png)

```python
from secretpy import Bifid
from secretpy import CryptMachine

def encdec(machine, enc):
    dec = machine.decrypt(enc)
    print (dec)
    print("----------------------------------")
    return dec

encrypted = "snbwmuotwodwvcywfgmruotoozaiwghlabvuzmfobhtywftopmtawyhifqgtsiowetrksrzgrztkfctxnrswnhxshylyehtatssukfvsnztyzlopsv"
dict = open("plz","r").readlines()[::-1]
for k in dict:
	k = k.strip()
	cipher = Bifid()
	alphabet = []
	for i in k:		
		alphabet.append(i)
	cm = CryptMachine(Bifid(), 5)
	cm.set_alphabet(alphabet)
	encrypted = encdec(cm,encrypted)
```

### Flag: flag{t0ld_y4_1t_w4s_3z}

# modus_operandi
![](modus.png)

> Hint
> <200

Connecting to the nc service we are asked to find out if the block cipher used is ECB or CBC. 

![](modus-0.png)

It's easy to determine if the block cipher used is ECB or CBC from the ciphertext since we control the plaintext. Since ECB mode encrypts every 16 bytes block independently, two equal plaintext blocks shall result in two equal ciphertext blocks. The problem here is when all queries answered correctly the server doesn't send the flag :frowning_face: . So we have to store our answers and convert them to binary with ECB standing for 0 and CBC standing for 1.

![](modus-1.png)

```python
from pwn import remote
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

p = remote("crypto.chal.csaw.io",5001)
flag = ""
p.recvline()
for _ in range(176):
	line = p.recvline()
	p.sendline("A"*32)
	data = p.recvline().strip()
	if "Ciphertext" not in data:
		p.interactive()

	print p.recvline()
	data=data.replace("Ciphertext is:  ","")
	if data[:32] == data[32:64]:
		print data, "ecb"
		flag += "0"
		p.sendline('ECB')
	else:
		print data ," cbc"
		p.sendline('CBC')
		flag += "1"
print long_to_bytes(int(flag,2))
p.close()
```

![](authy-0.png)

In order to access the flag, we need turn admin=True & access_sensitive=True & entrynum=7.

The first two parameters can be easily exploited with url encoding:

![](authy-1.png)

The entrynum is set after the info update so we will use [hash_extender](https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender) to append entrynum=7 in our payload.
```python
info = {"admin": "False", "access_sensitive": "False" }
        info.update(payload)
        info["entrynum"] = 783
```
Since we don't know the secret length the server is using we need to brute force that until we get our flag! We will get a valid signature for secret length = 13 !
