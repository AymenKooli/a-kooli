I played with Fword Team in CSAW CTF Qualification Round 2020 and managed to solve all the crypto tasks :partying_face:
![](c.png)

To be honnest, I think the tasks were poorly designed and guessy. In this article, I'll provide writeups for:

  - [x] difib
  - [x] modus_operandi
  - [x] authy
  - [x] adversarial
  - [x] smallsurp

# difib

> Hints 
>  1. Length of keys is 25, which (cleaned-up) ramblings would fit that?
>  2. If near-perfect ramblings are used to encrypt in order, how should it be decrypted?
>  3. The guard want's a legible message they can read in!
  
From the challenge's title we can guess that this is going to be about **[bifid cipher]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifid_cipher). We will need to decode the message give: `snbwmuotwodwvcywfgmruotoozaiwghlabvuzmfobhtywftopmtawyhifqgtsiowetrksrzgrztkfctxnrswnhxshylyehtatssukfvsnztyzlopsv` using a key from the ramblings given:

For bifid cipher, they key needs to be a perfect pangram with 25 chars long. A perfect pangram is a sentence that uses each letter of the alphabet only one time. 
We can see in our encrypted message that the letter '***j***'  isn't used. That will help us deduce that key doesn't have the letter '***j***' . From the first hint, we have clean up the ramblings, so first of all we will remove every non-alphabetic char and the letter j. With every thing cleaned-up we will have 20 possible keys:

I've tried using each one of them but none worked. Then, I tried using all the keys inverted and successively and got the message.

`xustxsomexunnecessaryxtextxthatxholdsxabsolutelyxnoxmeaningxwhatsoeverxandxbearsxnoxsignificancextoxyouxinxanyxway`

Cleaning up that message we will have: 

`just some unnecessary text that holds absolutely no meaning whatsoever and bears no significance to you in any way`

Sending that to the server gives us the flag.

```python
from secretpy import Bifid
from secretpy import CryptMachine

def encdec(machine, enc):
    dec = machine.decrypt(enc)
    print (dec)
    print("----------------------------------")
    return dec

encrypted = "snbwmuotwodwvcywfgmruotoozaiwghlabvuzmfobhtywftopmtawyhifqgtsiowetrksrzgrztkfctxnrswnhxshylyehtatssukfvsnztyzlopsv"
dict = open("plz","r").readlines()[::-1]
for k in dict:
	k = k.strip()
	cipher = Bifid()
	alphabet = []
	for i in k:		
		alphabet.append(i)
	cm = CryptMachine(Bifid(), 5)
	cm.set_alphabet(alphabet)
	encrypted = encdec(cm,encrypted)
```

### Flag: flag{t0ld_y4_1t_w4s_3z}

# modus_operandi
![](modus.png)

> Hint
> <200

Connecting to the nc service we are asked to find out if the block cipher used is ECB or CBC. 

![](modus-0.png)

It's easy to determine if the block cipher used is ECB or CBC from the ciphertext since we control the plaintext.
